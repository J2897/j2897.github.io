I'm J2897, a UK-based programmer focused on refining my existing skills while continually expanding into new areas of expertise.

As of September 2024, I'm working on an evolving project titled **ProverbialPursuits**. While the final structure is still in development, the core idea revolves around leveraging scripts I've written in various programming languages to empower AI agents to craft engaging, narrative-driven stories. These stories are intended to captivate diverse audiences and, if successful, could serve as the foundation for generating short, dynamic videos over 5 minutes long.

Of course, the design and execution of the project will need to respect the limitations and policies of the services it relies on. However, the goal is to produce something compelling within these constraints.
